## About
This CV Creator is the first project created for The Odin Project's [React JS](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/node-path-javascript-cv-application) section. The main objectives were to practice the basic concepts in React which included working with state, props and handling inputs. Users can input their details into the cv editor and add skills, educations and work experiences which are displayed in the professional cv format. Each block of information the user adds can be easily deleted from the preview by clicking the delete button next to the corresponding info.

These are some of the challenges I faced while making this project:
- Remembering to bind each event handler while wondering why the event wouldn't work!
